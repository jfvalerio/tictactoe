# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple web application that lets the user(s) play a game of tic-tac-toe.

## Technologies Used:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

## How to install:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`
2. Install the node modules using `npm install`

## How to run the program:

1. First, build the program using `npm run build`
2. Then, run the program using `npm run start`
3. If in development, run the program using `npm run dev`

## Project Structure:

- /components - Reusable pieces of code that could be added to the pages.
- /pages - The pages in the website. Automatic routing: index.tsx = /.
- /pages/api - An optional back-end for Next.js. A separate Node.js server is not needed for simple REST API Requests.
- /public - Directory for image files and icons

## Notes:

There is a lot of room for improvement and additional features that could be added to this application. Things like an undo button, customizable player names, scoring system, and overall improvement in UI design. However, I think that a simple solution that accomplishes the tasks specified is best for tasks with short deadlines. If the users still find this lacking, I am very willing to add improvements in the future.
